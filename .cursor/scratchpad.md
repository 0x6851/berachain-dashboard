6. Tooltips should be accessible via both mouse and keyboard interactions
7. React Query provides powerful caching and state management features that significantly improve data fetching
8. Writing tests helps catch edge cases and ensures component reliability

## Plan: Integrate CoinGecko Supply Data

### Background and Motivation
- The current dashboard uses a placeholder supply source. We now have a reliable supply history from CoinGecko via the `/api/coingecko` endpoint.
- This integration will provide accurate historical supply data for BERA, enhancing the dashboard's reliability and user experience.

### Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Data Consistency:** Ensure that the CoinGecko data is consistent with the dashboard's expected format.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API failures or unexpected data formats.
- **Performance:** Consider caching strategies to minimize API calls and improve load times.

### High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Update API Integration:**
   - Modify the dashboard's data fetching logic to use the `/api/coingecko` endpoint.
   - Ensure the data is parsed correctly and integrated into the existing supply history state.

2. **Update UI Components:**
   - Update any UI components that display supply data to reflect the new data source.
   - Ensure that charts and panels are updated to use the new supply history.

3. **Testing:**
   - Write tests to verify that the new data source is correctly integrated and displayed.
   - Ensure that the dashboard behaves as expected with the new data.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new data source and any changes in the dashboard's functionality.

### Project Status Board

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Completed updating the documentation to reflect the new CoinGecko supply data integration. The README.md now includes information about the new data source and setup instructions. All tasks for the CoinGecko integration are now complete. Awaiting further instructions.

### Lessons
- Ensure to handle API errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to users.

## Plan: Identify Data for BERA and BGT Inflation Charts

### Background and Motivation
- The current implementation incorrectly shows the same data for BERA and BGT inflation.
- According to the Berachain documentation, BERA's total supply is static except when BGT is burned, while BGT's supply increases due to emissions minus the amount burned.

### Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Data Accuracy:** Ensure that the data sources accurately reflect the supply dynamics of BERA and BGT.
- **Data Availability:** Identify what data is currently available and what is missing to accurately represent the inflation rates.

### High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Review Current Data Sources:**
   - Assess the current data sources for BERA and BGT supply.
   - Identify any discrepancies or missing data points.

2. **Identify Required Data:**
   - Determine the specific data points needed to calculate BERA and BGT inflation rates.
   - This includes:
     - Total supply of BERA (static except for BGT burns).
     - Total supply of BGT (increases with emissions minus burns).

3. **Data Collection Plan:**
   - Outline a plan to collect or fetch the necessary data from the CoinGecko API or other sources.
   - Ensure that the data is updated regularly to reflect the latest supply changes.

4. **Update Dashboard Components:**
   - Modify the `InflationPanel` and `SupplyChart` components to display the correct data for BERA and BGT.
   - Ensure that the UI clearly differentiates between BERA and BGT inflation.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Write tests to verify that the data is displayed correctly.
   - Validate the data against the Berachain documentation to ensure accuracy.

### Project Status Board
- [x] Review Current Data Sources
- [x] Identify Required Data
- [x] Data Collection Plan
- [x] Update Dashboard Components
- [ ] Testing and Validation

### Data Sources Review
**Current Data Sources:**
1. **CoinGecko API**
   - Provides: Historical supply data for BERA (up to 365 days)
   - Limitation: No BGT data, and only 1 year of history for free tier
2. **Official Berachain API**
   - Provides: Current total supply and circulating supply for BERA and BGT
   - Limitation: No historical data
3. **Dune Query** ([Dune Query 4740951](https://dune.com/queries/4740951))
   - Provides: BGT emissions and amount burned (historical)
   - Limitation: No direct BERA supply, but BGT burns can be used to adjust BERA supply

**Summary:**
- We have historical BERA supply (CoinGecko, limited to 1 year), current BERA supply (official API), and historical BGT emissions/burns (Dune).
- No direct historical BGT supply, but it can be calculated as cumulative emissions minus cumulative burns.
- BERA supply is static except for BGT burns (see docs).

### Identify Required Data
- **BERA Supply:**
  - Current total supply (from official Berachain API)
  - Historical supply data (from CoinGecko API, limited to 1 year)
  - Adjustments for BGT burns (from Dune Query)

- **BGT Supply:**
  - Current total supply (from official Berachain API)
  - Historical emissions and burns (from Dune Query)
  - Calculated as cumulative emissions minus cumulative burns

### Data Collection Plan
1. **Fetch Current Supply Data:**
   - Use the official Berachain API to fetch the current total supply for both BERA and BGT.
   - Ensure to handle any API errors gracefully.

2. **Fetch Historical BERA Supply Data:**
   - Use the CoinGecko API to fetch historical supply data for BERA (up to 365 days).
   - Store this data in a structured format for easy access.

3. **Fetch BGT Emissions and Burns:**
   - Use the Dune Query to fetch historical BGT emissions and burns.
   - Calculate the cumulative BGT supply as emissions minus burns.

4. **Data Integration:**
   - Integrate the fetched data into the dashboard's state management.
   - Ensure that the data is updated regularly to reflect the latest changes.

## New Feature & Bugfix Plan (May 2025)

### Background and Motivation
- **New Feature:** Add a fourth chart to the dashboard showing the total supply of $BERA, in addition to the existing circulating supply chart.
- **Bug:** The Market Cap and FDV values are not displaying correctly on the dashboard. This needs to be investigated and fixed.

### Key Challenges and Analysis
#### For the New Chart
- **Data Source:** Ensure we have reliable data for BERA total supply (likely from the official Berachain API or CoinGecko).
- **UI/UX:** The new chart should be visually consistent with the existing charts and clearly labeled as "Total Supply".

#### For Market Cap/FDV Bug
- **Data Consistency:** Market Cap and FDV require both price and supply data. If either is missing or mismatched, the values may not display.
- **Frontend Logic:** The calculation or rendering logic may be incorrect or referencing the wrong data keys.
- **API Response:** The API may not be returning the expected values, or the frontend may not be parsing them correctly.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Currently conducting testing and validation of the dashboard components to ensure they display the data correctly and function as expected.

## Background and Motivation
The dashboard is designed to display various metrics related to BERA and BGT, including supply data and emissions. The 'Missing duneEmissions' error indicates that the data expected from the Dune API is not being processed or used correctly in the frontend.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Data Fetching**: The `useDashboardData` hook fetches data from multiple endpoints, including the Dune API. The `fetchDuneEmissions` function is responsible for retrieving and mapping the emissions data.
2. **Data Structure**: The Dune API response structure must match the expected format in the frontend. Any mismatch can lead to errors.
3. **Error Handling**: The current implementation logs errors but may not provide enough context to diagnose the issue effectively.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Verify Dune API Response**: Ensure the response from the Dune API matches the expected structure. This includes checking the `emissions` array and its fields.
2. **Add Logging**: Implement logging in the `fetchDuneEmissions` function to capture the raw response and any errors encountered during data processing.
3. **Check Frontend Usage**: Identify all components that use the `duneEmissions` data and ensure they handle the data correctly.
4. **Test and Validate**: After making changes, test the application to ensure the error is resolved and the data is displayed correctly.

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Verify Dune API response structure
- [ ] Add logging in `fetchDuneEmissions`
- [ ] Identify components using `duneEmissions`
- [ ] Test and validate changes

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Awaiting confirmation to proceed with the outlined tasks.

## Lessons
- Ensure data structures match between API responses and frontend expectations.
- Implement comprehensive logging to aid in debugging.
